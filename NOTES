TODO

  - code cleanup

  - restructure so I can use simplification soundness proof (which uses prove
    tactic)

NEW FEATURES

  - using assumptions
    could work if they have the form "atom ≡ exp"

    although in that case it might be nicer with a general rewrite tactic

  - rewrite tactic

    How would it get the type of the equation to rewrite by? Could do an
    identity function trick and grab the hidden argument.

  - cong tactic

  - Look at "Proving Equalities in a Commutative Ring Done Right in Coq"
    by Grégoire and Mahboubi.

  - Think about regeneralize to other types.

  - Induction tactic.
