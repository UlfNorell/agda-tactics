  - code cleanup

NEW FEATURES

  - using assumptions
    could work if they have the form "atom ≡ exp"

    although in that case it might be nicer with a general rewrite tactic

    Target example: get sumSquare example working in one call.

  - a light-weight approach to assumptions: handle function types in simplify,
    simplifying both assumptions and goal

  - rewrite tactic

    How would it get the type of the equation to rewrite by? Could do an
    identity function trick and grab the hidden argument.

  - cong tactic

    Idea: traverse atoms and normalise any nat terms inside them

  - Look at "Proving Equalities in a Commutative Ring Done Right in Coq"
    by Grégoire and Mahboubi.

  - Think about regeneralize to other types.

  - Induction tactic.

  - List tactic

  - Combined List and Nat tactic. In the cancel proof there are lots of
    opportunities for reasoning about sum and product.
